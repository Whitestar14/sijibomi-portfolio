 <h2>Featured Website Projects</h2>
 <p>Here's a selection of the websites I've worked on over the years. Some are clones of Wordpress applications (yikes), redesigns of old websites and some were built from scratch. All (Most) ending up ending up pretty nicely.</p>

 <div><h2>So... about your new website</h2>
<p>I hope that's not too presumptous of me. But initial consultations are free, so you have absolutely nothing to lose, <i>And everything to gain.</i></p>
